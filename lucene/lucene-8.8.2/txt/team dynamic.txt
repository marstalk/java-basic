what is team dynamic?

Team dynamics refer to the interactions and relationships that exist between members of a team, including their communication patterns, roles, attitudes, and behaviors. It encompasses the way individuals within a team work together to achieve shared goals and objectives, as well as the overall atmosphere and culture of the team.

Effective team dynamics involve open communication, trust, mutual respect, and a shared sense of purpose among team members. Positive team dynamics can lead to increased productivity, better decision-making, and a more enjoyable and rewarding work environment. On the other hand, negative team dynamics can lead to conflict, reduced morale, and decreased productivity.
